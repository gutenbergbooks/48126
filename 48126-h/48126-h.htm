are not represented by the formations of this region, yet of the five
major chapters or eras into which all of time has been divided by
geologists, at least some parts of each have left their traces in this
area.</p>
<p>Whether on the brink of the mighty Grand Canyon, among beautiful
logs of the Petrified Forest, or beneath the lofty walls of Zion&mdash;the
&ldquo;Rainbow of the Desert&rdquo;&mdash;one looks upon rocks which are
not alone curious or colorful, but which are also records of the past
inscribed and illustrated in an intensely interesting manner. In one
place is seen the sand of ancient dunes, in another the border of an
early sea, or perhaps the floodplain of mighty rivers, and in all of
these remain the unmistakable evidences of life&mdash;plants and animals
preserved to make a reality of the living, moving past. Everywhere
are found the evidences of those great processes of nature&mdash;erosion
of the high country, land formation in the low country, and mighty
crustal movements slowly raising or lowering the land in both.</p>
<p>From the rim of Grand Canyon one not only looks down through
tremendous space, but also through time, glimpsing the record of
vast ages, measurable not in centuries but in millions and even hundreds
of millions of years. There in the bottom of that mighty chasm
are found rocks formed during the first and oldest era&mdash;rocks in
which the original structure has been entirely modified by great
heat and pressure and in which no evidence of life has been found.
There in the Grand Canyon are also seen two other great series
of rocks, those of the second era which are partially altered and
which contain earliest traces of plants, and those of the succeeding
era in which are preserved primitive animals of many types.</p>

<p>Rocks of the fourth great era&mdash;the age of dinosaurs&mdash;lend color
to the Painted Desert, and to the sheer walls of Zion Canyon.
Beautiful little Bryce Canyon to the north boasts of some of the
most recently formed rocks in the region&mdash;those of the fifth and
last era, the age of mammals. The great volcanic mountains and
the marvelous features of erosion, such as the canyons and the
desert cliffs, are also developments of this most recent chapter.
In brief, the Grand Canyon region affords some wonderfully interesting
glimpses of ancient landscapes during many different parts
of the earth&rsquo;s history, and these make the past a moving, living thing.</p>

<h3 id="c3">THE EARTH&rsquo;S OLDEST ROCKS
<br /><span class="small">(THE ARCHEAN ERA)</span></h3>
<p>Looking into the depths of Grand Canyon from any point
within the Bright Angel section, one is immediately impressed
by the narrow V-shaped gorge cut in the black rocks at the bottom.
This is popularly termed the Granite or Inner Gorge. Within its
walls one is in another world, both scenically and geologically.
Their steep, bare sides, whose surfaces are chaotic in the extreme,
have a history&mdash;long and complex. The rocks of which they are
formed&mdash;some of the oldest known today on the surface of the
earth&mdash;partially tell the story of the first great era in geologic
history.</p>
<p>Other rocks of this, the Archean age, are found in the Rockies,
in the Adirondacks of New York, and to a very great extent in
eastern Canada. In the last named place they contain valuable
deposits of iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper. Rocks which probably
also correspond in age occur in Scandinavia, Brazil, China, India,
and central Africa.</p>
<p>At the Grand Canyon, although we are impressed by the depth
of the dark Archean rocks, beneath the plateau surface approximately
a mile, yet we marvel even more when we contemplate
their great age and the important series of events whose history
they partially record. Built up originally as great horizontal deposits
of sand and mud, they were bent by mighty crustal movements
until high mountains, probably comparable to the present Alps,
were formed. Pressures from the northwest and southeast apparently
folded them. The rocks themselves were greatly compressed
and heated, with the result that complete recrystallization and the
development of a banded structure were brought about. The
present vertical attitude of these ancient beds, together with their
dense crystalline character, is evidence of the great depth at which
they were formed and of the extreme pressures to which they were
subjected. In brief, the rocks that we see today in the Canyon bottom
represent merely the roots of once lofty mountains, and the flat
surface cut on these rocks is an old plain that resulted from the
wearing down of high country in this region.</p>

<p>As yet no definite traces of either plant or animal life have been
found in rocks of the Archean age in Grand Canyon. Though various
forms of life may have existed then, and may have been preserved
in the original rocks, their record has since been entirely
removed by those extreme pressures which altered even the composition
and structure of the rocks themselves.</p>
<h3 id="c4">GRANITE IN GRAND CANYON
<br /><span class="small">(THE ARCHEAN ERA)</span></h3>
<p>Within the black, crystalline rocks of the Inner Gorge may be
seen many large streaks, bands or irregular masses of a lighter
color. From the Canyon rim these appear white, but from nearby
they are usually pink. These light colored rocks are granites with a
coarse crystalline texture.</p>
<p>Granites derive their name from their granular texture. They
are formed by the slow cooling of molten masses that have been
forced into older rocks from the earth&rsquo;s interior. From a similar
source are formed lavas and volcanic ash, but these flow out or
are ejected on the surface of the earth where they cool so rapidly
that no crystals form. Exceptionally fast cooling or chilling of
molten masses, moreover, forms volcanic glass or obsidian. It is by
the application of this same principle that crystal forming is prevented
in the manufacture of common glass.</p>
<p>The large size of the crystals forming the granite that fills cracks
and fissures of the Inner Gorge at Grand Canyon indicates the
considerable depth at which it was formed and is further evidence
of the great mountains that existed in this region during the first
era in geologic history.</p>

<br />THE ALGONKIAN ERA</h2>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">TILTED ROCKS OF THE SECOND ERA. GRAND CANYON</span></p>
</div>
<p>Rocks formed during the second great era of the earth&rsquo;s history
are distinctive in several respects. They are not highly altered
or completely changed in form and structure as are those of the
oldest era, but are largely free from such changes and, for the
most part, similar to rocks which are seen in the process of formation
today. Furthermore, they are known to contain definite traces
of plant life, though no certain forms of animal life have yet been
found in them. They represent a period probably as great as all
of subsequent time.</p>
<h3 id="c6">ALGONKIAN ROCKS IN GRAND CANYON</h3>
<p>Along Bright Angel Canyon and in several other places in the
Grand Canyon, rocks of Algonkian age, representing accumulations
of sediments several thousand feet in thickness, are found. Below
and to the north of Desert View (southeast of Cape Royal on the
North Rim) they form the open floor of the Canyon. Everywhere
the most conspicuous layer of this series is a mud rock of brilliant
vermilion color. However, the rocks also include a conglomerate or
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
pebble layer, a dark limestone formed principally by plants, and a
purple quartzite made by the consolidation of the grains of a
sandstone.</p>
<h3 id="c7">FORMATION OF MOUNTAINS
<br /><span class="small">(THE ALGONKIAN ERA)</span></h3>
<p>The Algonkian rocks of the Grand Canyon region were bent and
broken into mountains at an early date. In many places sloping
layers showing the steep angle at which they were tilted are easily
visible, even from the Canyon rim. Folded areas and strata which
have been shattered are also conspicuous features here and there.
The mountains which they formed, however, are now missing for
they were worn away in large measure by slow erosion. Today
only remnants&mdash;small hills on a general level surface&mdash;remain in the
lower parts of Grand Canyon to tell the story.</p>
<h3 id="c8">EARLY CLIMATES
<br /><span class="small">(THE ALGONKIAN ERA)</span></h3>
<p>The rocks of Algonkian age are roughly estimated to be at least
six or seven hundred million years old, yet from all indications they
were formed under conditions of climate not unlike those of far
later periods of history. In several parts of the world traces of
great ice sheets&mdash;glaciers which scratched and eroded the surface&mdash;are
found preserved in Algonkian rocks. In other places, including
the Grand Canyon, ancient flows of lava are found where they
gushed out upon the surface of an old land mass. Among the
rocks below Desert View (Navajo) Point and bordering on the
Colorado River may readily be seen several black cliffs formed by
the volcanic activity of this early age.</p>
<p>The brilliant red shales of Algonkian age found in the lower parts
of the Grand Canyon were formed as muds, accumulated probably
by large rivers. In these muds are found preserved great quantities
of ripple marks, indications of changing currents, also the moulds
of salt crystals, and large shrinkage cracks resulting from a very hot
sun. In brief, these criteria point toward a hot and probably arid
climate in this region during that chapter of history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c9">OLDEST KNOWN LIFE
<br /><span class="small">(THE ALGONKIAN ERA)</span></h3>
<p>The oldest forms of life represented in rocks of Grand Canyon
are found in strata of the Second, or Algonkian, Era. Certain layers
of limestone showing peculiar structural patterns on their surfaces
are interpreted as being the reefs built up through the activities
of primitive one-celled plants known as algae. Similar structures
are being formed today by plants of this type. Near Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry, West Virginia, for example, algae are building up limestone
layers almost identical to the fossil ones found in the Algonkian
rocks of Grand Canyon. In this connection, it is interesting to note
that because of this similarity of the present to the past, the reality
of the ancient plant structures was recognized a few years ago.
They were discovered at a place in the Grand Canyon just west of
the mouth of Bright Angel Creek.</p>

<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER III
<br />THE PALEOZOIC ERA</h2>
<p>It was during the third or middle chapter in the earth&rsquo;s history
that all of the apparently horizontal, upper layers in the Grand
Canyon walls were formed. As will be seen in the succeeding pages,
some of these rocks are sandstones formed from the sands of early
beaches or sand dune areas, others are shales&mdash;the hardened muds
of ancient river deltas&mdash;and still others are limestones built up by
accumulations of plant and animal remains on sea bottoms. All
are rocks formed by the deposition of sediments by wind and
water during vast intervals of time. In them have been hidden
and preserved many forms of life. Seashells, footprints, fern
impressions, and various other traces of early plants and animals
remain to tell the story of these ancient times. It is of special
interest to note that in rocks formed during the earliest part of
this chapter are found the first definite traces of animal life, that
in other rocks of this chapter have been found evidences of primitive
fish, and that in the most recent rocks of this group occur the
traces of early reptiles, insects, ferns, and cone-bearing plants. In
the walls of Grand Canyon examples of all of these fossils have
been found, and these will be described in detail in the succeeding
pages.</p>
<h3 id="c11">FIRST ANIMAL LIFE&mdash;THE TONTO ROCKS
<br /><span class="small">(CAMBRIAN PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>Great highlands which were formed in the Grand Canyon region
during the Second Era of history were afterwards gradually worn
away by erosion until near the start of the next era a flat, almost
featureless plain existed. Here and there, however, isolated hills of
dark, crystalline rocks of the First Era stood above the general surface,
as seen opposite Yaki point. In other places, such as to the
west of where Bright Angel Creek now flows, small mountains of red
Algonkian rocks (Second Era) remained. Around and against these,
sediments were then deposited. Pebbles and sands accumulated,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
forming a thick layer which today appears as the brown sandstone
rim of the Inner Gorge. These represent the first deposits of the
Third Era. But the sea was encroaching upon the land during this
period, and gradually the sand deposited near shore was covered
by mud and this in turn by lime far out from the beach. Today
this series of sand, mud and lime is found represented in the rocks
of the Tonto Platform in Grand Canyon.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">SCENE ON CAMBRIAN SEA FLOOR IN GRAND CANYON REGION (RECONSTRUCTION. MUSEUM NORTHERN ARIZONA)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Along the Tonto Trail a few hundred yards east of Indian Gardens
numerous primitive sea animals have been found buried and preserved
in layers of thin shale. Many of these are creatures with
rounded shells smaller than the nail of a person&rsquo;s little finger, others
are animals related to the snail, and still others are crab-like
creatures known as trilobites. The trilobites undoubtedly were the
rulers of that age for they excelled not only in numbers but in size.
Some specimens from Grand Canyon have measured over three
inches in length. Despite this size, however, the trilobites and their
associates from the Tonto Platform represent some of the earliest
known forms of animal life.</p>

<h3 id="c12">THE MISSING PERIODS OF THE THIRD ERA
<br /><span class="small">(ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN PERIODS)</span></h3>
<p>The geologist has found that two long periods of history are
lacking in the great succession of ages represented by the strata
in the Grand Canyon walls. These missing periods which belong
to the Third Era are known as the Ordovician, the time when
fish first appeared in the seas, and the Silurian, the time when
millipeds and scorpions became our first air breathers. These ages
immediately followed the Cambrian and involved millions of years.
The absence of the first of them is explained by some geologists
as the result of its rocks having been completely worn away at a
later time. It seems more probable, however, that the Grand Canyon
region was above sea level during these two ages so that no
sediments were accumulated and consequently no rocks formed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 id="c13">THE AGE OF FISH

<p class="caption"><span class="small">A FRESH WATER FISH OF DEVONIAN AGE</span></p>
</div>
<p>During that period of geologic time commonly known as the
&ldquo;age of fish,&rdquo; sands and limes were accumulated on the surface of
the Grand Canyon region filling in old river channels and burying
the bodies of fish and other animals. The deposits formed at
this time were later eroded to a large extent. The surface of the
land was worn and washed away until finally only isolated patches
or pockets of limestone and sandstone remained. These we find
today exposed in the walls of the Grand Canyon occurring just at
the base of the great Redwall cliff in about fifteen different localities.</p>
<p>Although fish were rulers of the age during Devonian times,
they were of primitive types and apparently depended for defense
upon bony skin armour rather than upon speed. The plates and
scales of fresh-water fish have been found preserved in the lavender
rocks of this age in the Grand Canyon.</p>
<h3 id="c14">SEA LIFE FROM THE NORTH&mdash;THE REDWALL LIMESTONE
<br /><span class="small">(MISSISSIPPIAN OR LOWER CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD)</span></h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">REDWALL FOSSILS (NATURAL SIZE)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>One of the most prominent and conspicuous features of the
Grand Canyon is the great red cliff of limestone about midway
in its walls. This cliff is the highest in the Canyon&mdash;averaging about
550 feet in the area of Bright Angel Canyon. In most places it
is almost vertical, and in some it even overhangs to such an extent
that a visitor once aptly said, &ldquo;The Washington Monument might
be placed beneath it and kept out of the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the prospector this formation is known as the Blue Lime; to
the geologist it is the Redwall Limestone. Both are correct.
Actually the rock is a rather pure limestone of a grey or bluish
color, but in most places where seen, its surface has been stained
a bright red by iron oxides from above. It appears throughout
the Grand Canyon as a wide band or ribbon of red.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/pg012b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="852" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">HAVASU FALLS IN REDWALL LIMESTONE. GRAND CANYON</span></p>
</div>
<p>Large amphitheaters, many curving alcoves, caves, and solution tunnels are
all characteristic features of the great Redwall. It is composed of relatively
pure lime so rain and other waters have a chemical action upon it&mdash;they
leach and dissolve it. Waters all tend to drain toward curving centers,
and so increase this curving. Everywhere the rounding off of corners takes place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The origin of the Redwall Limestone is as interesting as its form.
The purity of the lime indicates that it was built up in a relatively
wide and quiet sea. Its composition represents a vast accumulation
of the skeletons of ancient plants and animals. Seashells are
found in great numbers, some of them preserved in delicate detail.
These and other forms of ocean life clearly indicate that a great sea
connection then existed between this region and that of western
Canada to the north.</p>
<h3 id="c15">TRACKS IN THE SUPAI SANDSTONE
<br /><span class="small">(PERMIAN PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>During that period in geological history known as the Permian,
when some of the beds of soft coal in eastern America were being
formed, a large area in northern Arizona was receiving red sediments
from the east, probably carried by rivers from the granitic
highlands of that region. Today these sediments appear in the
Grand Canyon walls as alternating layers of red sandstone and
shale immediately above the great Redwall. They are almost a
thousand feet in thickness.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">TRACKS OF SHORT-LEGGED PREHISTORIC ANIMAL. SUPAI FORMATION. GRAND CANYON</span></p>
</div>
<p>When the red beds were accumulating in this region, the climate
probably was more or less arid; the vegetation consisted principally
of ferns and other lowly plants; and the animal life included a group
of large but primitive four-footed creatures. Numerous tracks of the
latter, preserved in the walls of Grand Canyon, have provided one
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of the most interesting discoveries of recent years. Some of these
footprints are several inches in length, and the number of toes
varies between three and five. They show no close relationship
to the tracks of other localities, and apparently represent a fauna
new to North America.</p>

</div>
<p>Concerning the conditions under which the topmost red formation
of the Grand Canyon (the Hermit Shale) was developed, and
the nature of its origin, we have today a rather
definite and interesting picture. A wealth of fossil
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
plants and a number of tracks of animals have been found excellently
preserved in its muddy layers, and by means of these and
other indications the following conclusions have been drawn.</p>
<p>The Hermit Shale represents accumulations of mud and fine sandy
material deposited probably by streams flowing from the northeast.
Here and there are found evidences of pools and arroyos with wavy
ripple marks on their borders and a thin film of shiny slime covering
the surface. The trails of worms, the footprints of small salamander-like
animals, and the fronds of ferns, mostly mascerated or wilted,
are found delicately preserved in this slime. Raindrop impressions,
the molds of salt crystals and numerous sun-cracks also add to the
picture. This region has been described by Dr. David White as &ldquo;the
scene of showers, burning sun, hailstorms, occasional torrents and
periods of drought and drying up of pools&rdquo; during Hermit times.</p>
<p>Thirty-five species of plants are at present known from the Hermit
Shale of Grand Canyon. Many of these have not been found
elsewhere in the world, though some were representatives of European
plants, and others had their closest relations in central Asia,
India, Australia, Africa, and South America. This fossil flora consists
principally of ferns and small cone-bearing plants, all of which were
relatively dwarfed in size and appear less dense than those of corresponding
age found in eastern America. They apparently indicate a
semi-arid climate with long dry seasons, for the absence of moist-climate
and swamp-loving types is noticeable.</p>
<p>Several insect wings have been found in the Hermit Shale, one
of which was four inches in length. Numerous footprints of vertebrate
animals have also been found, and undoubtedly represent an
interesting fauna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c17">WIND-BLOWN SAND&mdash;THE COCONINO
<br /><span class="small">(PERMIAN PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>The light-colored formation which appears as a conspicuous
ribbon-like band around the upper part of the Grand Canyon has
long presented a puzzle concerning its origin. The grains of white
sand of which it is composed apparently were deposited at steep
angles, for the many and varied slopes which were formed may be
readily seen today on the surface of the rock. These slopes were
probably once the lee sides of sand dunes deposited by winds in
an area bordering the sea. We find the only traces of life in this
formation represented by the trails of ancient worms and insects,
and by the foot-prints of early lizard, or salamander-like creatures.
Already the tracks of some 27 species of animals have been discovered
in this sandstone within the Grand Canyon, though strangely
enough no bones have yet been located.</p>

<p>Along both sides of Grand Canyon at the top, two buff and
gray layers of limestone stand out as massive cliffs separated by
a tree-covered slope. The upper of these limestones forms the
plateau surface and may be seen for a great distance in every
direction. Both layers were formed as the result of vast accumulations
of organic and sandy materials on sea bottoms, and in places
are composed largely of the remains of marine life&mdash;shells, corals
and sponges. The teeth of sharks have also been found in the upper
limestone.</p>

<p>During the early stages of the period when these marine animals
lived and multiplied in the region, a great body of salt water extended

retreated from the area. Soon, however, marine waters advanced
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
once more and another sea was formed with its shoreline extending
eastward even beyond the region in which we now find Grand
Canyon. Evidences of the second and larger sea are found beyond
Flagstaff to the south, in the Painted Desert to the east, and almost
to Zion Canyon to the north.</p>
<p>The presence of corals and sharks&rsquo; teeth not only indicates that
this region was covered on more than one occasion by marine
waters, but also suggests that these seas were warm and shallow.
This is estimated to have been some 200 million years ago.</p>

<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER IV
<br />THE MESOZOIC ERA</h2>
<p>The Fourth Chapter of the earth&rsquo;s history is commonly known
as &ldquo;the age of dinosaurs.&rdquo; Large reptiles were the dominating
forms of life all over the world during this age. Landscapes and
types of climate varied considerably, and in the Grand Canyon
region they changed completely several times. During some periods
ocean bodies covered the country; at others desert winds piled up
dunes on the surface. Again this region was the flood plain of
rivers, where pebbles, mud and great logs of pine were washed in
and deposited. At still other times coal was formed in some
quantity. All of these interesting features of the Fourth Chapter
will be briefly treated in the pages following. Their records as
found at Zion Canyon to the north, in the Painted Desert to the
east, and at the Petrified Forest to the south are such that a visitor
to the region can scarcely help but marvel and wonder at their
meaning.</p>
<h3 id="c20">REMNANTS OF YOUNGER STRATA&mdash;RED BUTTE AND CEDAR MOUNTAIN
<br /><span class="small">(MOENKOPI FORMATION: TRIASSIC PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>Two isolated hills of unusual interest rise above the plateau surface
near Grand Canyon. Looking east from Desert View (Navajo)
Point one of these, a flat-topped mesa called Cedar Mountain,
may be seen. The other, known as Red Butte, is a rounded hill
about fifteen miles to the south of Grand Canyon village. The
most interesting feature of these hills is found in the fact that they
are composed for the most part of red sandstones and shales
which once formed a continuous layer over this entire plateau region.
These same rocks are found throughout southern Utah to the north,
and in the Painted Desert to the east. Except at Red Butte and
Cedar Mountain they have been completely stripped off and eroded
away from the vicinity of Grand Canyon. The time involved in
this erosion was tremendous and the consequences widespread.
As a result the present flat plateau surface was formed&mdash;a great
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
plain high above sea level. The persistence of Red Butte and Cedar
Mountain against time and the elements is easily explained, moreover,
by the hard lava cap of the former and the protecting layer
of pebble-rock on top of the latter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">RED BUTTE</span></p>
</div>
<p>The red sandstones and shales found in Red Butte and Cedar
Mountain were formed from sands and muds accumulated during
the early part of the Triassic Age&mdash;the beginning of the fourth
great era of history. Near Flagstaff at the southernmost limit of
the formation have been found many tracks and trails left by
small crawling animals which indicate a shore environment in that
section. In the same formation found in Utah and other places
to the north are many seashells of various
types. Gypsum, an indication of arid climate, is also found to a
large extent in the rocks of this group.</p>
<h3 id="c21">THE PETRIFIED FOREST
<br /><span class="small">(SHINARUMP AND CHINLE FORMATIONS; TRIASSIC PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>The Petrified Forests of northern Arizona and southern Utah were
formed from trees which grew during a period known as the Triassic.
The type of environment in the Painted Desert region during that
period makes a very interesting speculation. The landscape of this
ancient country, as interpreted from the present rock formations
found there, was that of a low, flat area, perhaps a floodplain,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
where rivers and streams meandered back and forth, depositing first
large pebbles and sand, and later a great thickness of finer material
consisting of sand and much mud. It was by these streams that a great
quantity of logs of evergreen trees was carried down probably
from mountains to the south or southwest. Many of the tree trunks
were worn and battered on the way,
and in this region (from southern Utah to the vicinity of Adamana
and Holbrook) they were buried in great numbers among the
depositing sediments. All four of the Petrified Forests south of
Adamana originated in this manner&mdash;and probably represent old
log-jams. Nine miles north of Adamana, however, is the North
Sigillaria Forest where the trees are found standing as they grew.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">PETRIFIED LOGS OF TRIASSIC AGE</span></p>
</div>
<p>A large majority of the fossil trees in Petrified Forest National
Monument represent a pine-like species belonging to a group now
extinct in the northern hemisphere. Some individuals of this type
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
have diameters as great as ten feet and heights of more than 200
feet. Four or five other varieties of tree occur but they are less
common and rather inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The process by which these trees were changed to stone took
place a very long time after they were buried beneath sands and
silts. At a time probably millions of years later, waters bearing in
solution the mineral silica passed through the rocks of this region.
Particle by particle wood was decayed, and almost simultaneously
it was replaced by silica. The brilliant colors found in much of it
are due to small quantities of iron and manganese which were
introduced in a similar manner.</p>
<p>The wicked-looking upper jaw of a phytosaur&mdash;relative of the
crocodile&mdash;has been discovered buried in one of the colorful mounds
of mud out in the Petrified Forest. In nearby deposits are found
still other fossils including ferns preserved in delicate detail and clamlike
shells. These, together with the petrified logs of evergreen trees, make
the picture very much alive and real to one whose imagination allows him to
review these fascinating early pages in history.</p>
<h3 id="c22">DINOSAUR TRACKS
<br /><span class="small">(WINGATE-KAYENTA; JURASSIC PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>Dinosaur means &ldquo;terrible lizard.&rdquo; Everyone has heard this name and attaches
to it at least a vague conception of a creature of peculiar shape and
tremendous size. In the dim far-away past these giant reptiles lived, developed
and died in many parts of this country, but to most of us, they are
only fantastic creatures in literature&mdash;not live or moving animals.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">DINOSAUR TRACKS. PAINTED DESERT</span></p>
</div>
<p>The reality of the dinosaur should become apparent to those who travel
through the Painted Desert region of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Arizona. In that country the grey and red hills of clay, the cliffs
of sand and the many brightly colored layers of hardened mud
represent a part of the ancient landscape in which lived the
&ldquo;terrible lizards.&rdquo; Furthermore, life definitely inserts itself into
this picture when a person sees in the rocks the very three-toed
tracks left by the dinosaur. Who can deny the story of life when
he can place his fingers in the foot impressions and measure the
strides of these animals&mdash;many of them&mdash;both large and small?
Such is the privilege of those who visit the Painted Desert just south
of Tuba City.</p>
<p>The tracks of the dinosaurs are found in rocks which apparently
were formed from river deposits of sands and muds. In other
rocks closely associated have been found the bones of dinosaurs,
other reptiles, and animals related to the frog or toad. Some of
these creatures apparently were &ldquo;largely if not entirely terrestrial
in habit&rdquo; while others probably lived in either fresh water streams
or swamps.</p>

<h3 id="c23">THE ROCKS OF ZION CANYON AND RAINBOW NATURAL BRIDGE
<br /><span class="small">(NAVAJO SANDSTONE; JURASSIC PERIOD)</span></h3>
<p>The lure of a desert with its drifting sands, its scattered oases,
and its broad extent has ever been great. Today in the Southwest,
cut off from the moist ocean breezes of the west by the lofty Sierra
Nevadas and further isolated by the Rocky Mountains to the east,
is America&rsquo;s great desert region. Here the winds and the rains
are constantly at work tearing down and sculpturing the great land
masses, while in places the wind is piling up the sand and debris to
form dunes and new lands.</p>
<p>Far back in history, probably in what is known as the Jurassic
Period, southwestern United States witnessed conditions of climate
and environment which were perhaps somewhat comparable though
probably far more desert-like than those which exist today. The
land which had been raised in the preceding period to form a great
flood-plain remained above sea level. Lofty mountains were formed
to the west and like the Sierras of today, they robbed the east-travelling
winds of their moisture. These mountains were very high
and furnished a vast supply of sediment which was carried down
into the arid basin to the east, worked and reworked by the wind,
and finally deposited as a great layer of sand.</p>

<p>The beautiful Vermilion Cliffs and the White Cliffs of southern
Utah which together form the walls of Zion Canyon, the red sandstone
out of which is carved Rainbow Natural Bridge, and the
jagged Echo Cliffs seen to the northeast of Desert View (Navajo)
Point at Grand Canyon are all monuments of the Jurassic Age.
These high walls are of sandstone&mdash;formed from sand steeply piled
at varying angles. They have been aptly called &ldquo;cliffs of fossil
sand dunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While desert winds and a burning sun were playing a prominent
part in the Grand Canyon region, during the Jurassic Age, other
sections of the country were favored with a moist climate and
luxuriant vegetation. Dinosaurs and other reptiles waded about in
swamps and developed to tremendous sizes. The country teemed
with life, very different from that of today, yet none the less interesting.</p>

</div>
<p>During the last part of the &ldquo;Age of Dinosaurs,&rdquo; in that period of
history known as the Cretaceous, much of northeastern Arizona,
southern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico apparently was
submerged beneath a sea. Mollusks abounded, and various other
types of water animals swam or crawled in this region. Their shells
were buried and preserved among the muds and limes which were
accumulating, and today many of them are found in the rocks of
this age.</p>
<p>As time went on, the Cretaceous seas were expelled from their
basins in the Southwest. Low-lying coastal plains&mdash;two hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
and more miles wide&mdash;with luxuriant vegetation and perhaps swamps,
replaced them, and these new conditions were the means of
much coal formation. Great accumulations of vegetable matter,
buried beneath sediments brought down by streams, eventually
formed the many layers of coal which today are found in various
places in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. In the last named state
some extensive and valuable coal beds are found in rocks of this
age near Gallup. Impressions of leaves and pieces of fossil wood
are also numerous among these rocks and they indicate that there
was a warm, moist climate during that period in which they grew.</p>
<p>The Cretaceous Period ended with a general change of conditions
or a revolution, the world over. Many of the seas were changed into
lands, new mountains were formed and the dinosaurs and giant
reptiles were largely replaced by mammals and other modern
varieties of life.</p>

<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER V
<br />THE CENOZOIC ERA</h2>
<p>Although chapter five is the most recent in the earth&rsquo;s history
and lasts up to the present day, evidences of its life and its
happenings are extremely meager in the Grand Canyon region.
With the exceptions of the fresh water deposits formed during the
very early part (Bryce Canyon formations) and of the many
volcanoes built in the later stages, no rocks were formed here during
that chapter. This region was then above sea level and erosion
was working continuously. The great level plain which today forms
the plateau surface at Grand Canyon was created by the wearing
away of overlying rocks. The Grand Canyon itself and also Zion
and Bryce Canyons were sculptured. In fact, all of the features of
erosion which today make this desert region so picturesque and
fanciful owe their origin to the various agents of erosion which have
been at work during this most recent chapter of the world&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Age of Mammals&rdquo; is a name often applied to the last
era. Creatures not unlike some of the most advanced forms of
life found today lived even in the early parts of this age. As the
era progressed, nevertheless, a development was noticeable until
finally in the very last part man himself appeared. Though few
remains of this interesting and comparatively recent life have been
found in northern Arizona and southern Utah, still a few elephant
tusks, some camel teeth and the more recent remains of early cliff
and pueblo dwellers give evidence of a thrilling history during parts
of this era.</p>
<p>In the following pages will be found brief sketches of some of
these interesting features represented in the Grand Canyon region.
The many activities of erosion such as canyon-forming, the eruption
of volcanoes, influences of the great ice sheets of the north,
crustal movements, fragmentary evidences of early mammals, and
lastly early man himself are all introduced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c26">BRYCE CANYON FORMATION
<br /><span class="small">(WASATCH: EOCENE EPOCH)</span></h3>
<p>The formation found at Bryce Canyon and at Cedar Breaks in
southern Utah has the distinction of being composed of the most
recently formed sedimentary rocks in this plateau region. It was
during the early part of the last great chapter of history that lime
and some sand were accumulating here in fresh water. They are
believed by most geologists to represent the deposits of ancient
lakes and in them are found freshwater mollusks. Rivers and other
agents of deposition probably also took a part in the forming of
these strata as is indicated by the great irregularity and variety
of sand and other sediments. Truly the origin of these rocks presents
an interesting problem.</p>

<p>The delicate and beautiful colors of Bryce are due to the white
limestone which in many places retains its creamy color, but in
others has been stained a vivid pink by the drainage from upland
washes. The Canyon itself is almost entirely the result of running
water which has carved and etched its pattern during geologically
recent times. Just as the Grand Canyon and Zion Canyon were
made possible by a great elevation of the land in this region, so
also was Bryce affected. The small streams of the Paunsagunt
Plateau were given power to cut into the sandstones and limestones
which form the Pink Cliffs, and due to the peculiar nature of these
rocks the many spires, promontories, and pinnacles were formed as
remnants of erosion in the valleys.</p>
<h3 id="c27">A GREAT EROSION SURFACE
<br /><span class="small">(CENOZOIC AGE)</span></h3>
<p>The level, flat and almost featureless skyline of Grand Canyon
is an outstanding characteristic of the plateau of northern Arizona.
This surface is fascinating to some; monotonous to others. To all,
it is one of the most striking features of the region. The history
which it represents, moreover, is of extreme interest and impressive
length. Here on the top of the great plateau is seen the
result of vast erosion. Long periods of work by water,
wind, and other elements have gradually worn away
strata that were once above. Just as erosion is forming
the Grand Canyon today, so it has accomplished this much greater task.
Several thousand feet of materials have been removed from the
surface over much of this entire region.</p>

</div>
<p>South of Grand Canyon, at Red Butte, east in the Painted Desert,
and north in Utah are found remnants of those rocks which once
formed a continuous layer over the present plateau. Red sandstones
and shales representing former sands and muds of shallow water
and beach, pebble-rocks and marls deposited by rivers and containing
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
the remains of cone-bearing trees, crocodiles, and dinosaurs&mdash;all
these rocks and probably others once gave color to this
area just as today they lend brilliance to the Painted Desert and
to southern Utah. In those places high cliffs mark the lines of recession&mdash;the
stages of the constant retreat of the rocks from the
Grand Canyon region before ever-working forces of erosion. Red
Butte to the south of Grand Canyon, on the other hand, has been
preserved as an isolated remnant of the same rocks by its hard,
resistant cap of lava. Thus we have mute evidence of a tremendously
large and wonderful story of former lands, and of their later
wearing away to leave the great plain which now forms the surface
of the plateau about Grand Canyon.</p>
<h3 id="c28">CRUSTAL MOVEMENT AT GRAND CANYON
<br /><span class="small">(CENOZOIC AGE)</span></h3>
<p>Many visitors to the Grand Canyon are distinctly surprised when
they find numerous seashells, corals, and sponges, beautifully
preserved in the limestone layer upon which they are standing.
The idea immediately occurs that this region was once beneath the
sea. Obviously then either the land has risen or the ocean has
receded.</p>
<p>A careful study of the region shows that the rock strata which
form the great plateau of northern Arizona have been bent into a
huge arch or dome. The Santa Fe railway travels steadily up grade
to the south rim of Grand Canyon which is 7,000 feet above sea
level. The north rim is a thousand feet higher, while fifteen miles
farther north a high point of 9,000 feet is attained. In southern
Utah the limestone layer which forms the top of Grand Canyon
passes beneath the surface at 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>Why crustal movements occur is not definitely known though
many theories have been advanced to explain them. It is significant,
nevertheless, that such movements have gone on in all parts of
the world many times in history, and that in many regions they are
taking place today. Parts of the California coast are known to be
rising, while some other parts of the country are sinking slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The question of whether or not the Grand Canyon region is still
rising today cannot be answered with assuredness, but certain it is
that it has been both above and below sea level at many different
times in history.</p>
<p>It is the slow sinking of the region which has made possible great
accumulations of sediments and the building up of rock layers. It
is the rising of the land which has brought about great cycles of
erosion such as apparently have occurred several times in the history
of the Southwest. Since today this region is high above sea level,
erosion is rapid. Not only does this elevation give the Colorado
River and its tributaries speed and power to erode downward, but
also it gives them unusual depth through which to cut and to carve
the canyons which are their valleys. Without the rising of this
plateau region, the colossal gorges, the weird, sculptured forms
of erosion, all of the fascinating and picturesque features of this
region could not be.</p>

<p>Very difficult is it for the average human fully to realize, to
comprehend the tremendous power of running water. One does
not question the origin of a wayside gulch cut out by recent
storms, nor is it hard to visualize the formation of some steep-walled
glen where a fast-rushing stream is found at work in its bottom.
The vast Grand Canyon, however, an extreme example of erosion,
seems a bit too large&mdash;too wide and deep&mdash;to be attributed alone
to the power of any river such as exists today. But the Grand

of the work of running water over a long period of history.</p>

<p>Those who have been to the rocky shores of the Colorado River
in Grand Canyon, who have heard its wild roar, and seen its mad
waves rush along their course, need no further introduction to the
power of this stream. It is a mighty river! In the open stretch
above the mouth of Bright Angel Creek its speed varies between
two and a half and ten miles an hour. Its width at the same
place is over one hundred yards and its depth between twelve and
forty-five feet. But the Colorado River alone would have made
but little progress
were it not for the
many rocks&mdash;boulders,
pebbles, and
sand grains&mdash;all of
which act as tools
and are constantly
gouging and cutting
as they move.
Just as sandpaper
rubbing over the
same place continuously
leaves its
groove, so this combination
of power and tools is ever carving its course. The
Colorado River during a vast period has cut almost a mile vertically
through all of the great rock layers now exposed in the walls of
Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>The width of the Grand Canyon, an average of about ten miles,
has been brought about by the wearing and washing-in of its sides
by natural processes of erosion. Rain, wind, frost, temperature
changes and plant action have all combined to break down the
Canyon walls. The soft rocks on the slopes are continually being
broken and removed; the more resistant ones in the cliffs are
undermined so in time fall down. While the river has been cutting
deeper, the Canyon&rsquo;s sides have been steadily receding. The
Grand Canyon itself is the valley of the Colorado, and its narrowness
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
rather than its width is the remarkable feature when compared
with the valleys of other rivers. This present canyon profile has
been brought about as the combined effects of an arid climate
and a rapidly downward cutting river.</p>
<p>Even a distant view of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon
bottom is sufficient to convince one of the tremendous transporting
power of this stream. Thus it not only does the work of cutting
downward, but also carries off the vast load of sand and silt which
is continually emptied into its waters. It has been aptly described
as being &ldquo;too thick to drink but too thin to plow.&rdquo; In this region
the river known at its headwaters as the &ldquo;Silvery Colorado&rdquo; bears
even a higher percentage of sediment than does the muddy
Mississippi-Missouri. It has been found from carefully made tests
by the United States Geological Survey that the Colorado River
carries past any given point in the Grand Canyon an average of
nearly a million tons of sand and silt every day. Thus has the
Grand Canyon been excavated!</p>
<h3 id="c30">THE FORMING OF ZION CANYON

<p>&ldquo;A Yosemite Valley in colors&rdquo;
is a very apt description which has
often been applied to Zion Canyon
in southern Utah. Sheer-walled with
a beautiful flat valley floor, this

size and shape, but in formation it
has a very different history.</p>

<p>The brilliant Vermilion Cliffs
which form the bottom two thousand
feet of Zion&rsquo;s walls and the
contrasting White Cliffs which rise
an additional thousand feet are
hard, resistant sandstones. Wherever
these rocks are found, they
form conspicuous perpendicular
cliffs because of their hardness, yet even they show the results of
the constant attacks of weather and erosion over long periods.
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
From once continuous layers, they have in many places gradually
been cut and dissected by running water until now numerous canyons
expose their secrets.</p>
<p>It was relatively late in the last chapter of the earth&rsquo;s history
(Cenozoic Era) that the cutting of Zion and associated canyons
was made possible by gradual though tremendous crustal movements
in the region. The then broad, low-lying country was raised several
thousand feet to about its present altitude. This was the means
of giving power to the streams, including the masterstream&mdash;the
Virgin River. Steadily and relentlessly these active agents of
erosion, heavy-laden with their tools, the muds, sands, and pebbles,
have been cutting notches and then canyons. Zion Creek itself,
which is one of the largest tributaries of the Virgin River, has cut
downward through all of the layers now exposed in the walls of its
canyon, and the rock fragments derived from these have been the
means of grinding and gouging. As the stream has struggled in
its course, these sides have slowly but surely receded through the
combined efforts of rain, wind, frost and plants. They have been
undermined and otherwise attacked, but as yet represent comparatively
little progress in widening. Beautiful Zion Canyon, therefore,
has been created as the result of crustal movements bringing into
action the effective cutting power of running water, assisted by
all the ever-working forces of disintegration and decay.</p>
<h3 id="c31">GLACIERS
<br /><span class="small">(PLEISTOCENE EPOCH)</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;What part did glaciers play in cutting the Grand Canyon?&rdquo;
This is a question asked almost daily on the rim of that great chasm.
Everyone has heard of the mighty ice sheets which somewhere back
in geologic history covered a large part of eastern and midwestern
United States. Many people have seen beautiful Yosemite Valley
in the far west, and have been told how it was carved by the action
of glaciers. It is not altogether strange, therefore, that visitors
to the Grand Canyon should associate the cutting power of ice
with that tremendous gash in the earth&rsquo;s surface. But geologists
agree that the glaciers of the Ice Ages had no direct part in the
story of Grand Canyon. No scratches or gouges made by ice
are to be found on the canyon walls, no great rock piles formed at a
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
glacier&rsquo;s front are in evidence, and lastly, the very V-shape of the
canyon itself is vastly different from the usual flat-bottomed valley
scooped out by moving ice.</p>
<p>During the last epoch of geologic history, climatic conditions
the world over altered very materially. Upon five different
occasions snow accumulated in the north to form extensive ice
sheets which advanced steadily toward the equator and then
retreated with a later change in conditions. These were not the
only ice ages in history, but they were of such a comparatively
recent date that their influence is strongly felt today in many parts
of the world. At the time of greatest expansion the glaciers reached
New York in the east, Missouri in the mid west, and Washington
in the far west. Contemporaneous with these main ice sheets,
furthermore, were large glaciers throughout the Rocky Mountains
and the Sierra Nevadas. In the mountains of Utah and even in
the San Francisco Peaks, just south of the Grand Canyon, are
found evidences of glaciers of this period. Evidently then, climatic
conditions in the Southwest as elsewhere were greatly different
from those of today. It is believed that there was much more
rainfall and less evaporation, as shown by the extensive lakes which
existed in this region at that time. Furthermore, the later melting
of the glaciers must have supplied a vast quantity of water to the
Colorado River causing it to be far larger and more powerful than
today.</p>

</div>
<p>Over a large part of the great plateau of northern Arizona are
found sheets of hard lava and cone-shaped craters. The center of
this volcanic activity is located in the San Francisco Peaks just
north of the town of Flagstaff, but lavas and cones are found
westward beyond Williams and to a considerable extent in every
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
other direction. Looking south from Grand Canyon these peaks
may be seen to rise high above the plateau and are a very beautiful
sight. From Flagstaff and Williams not only the mountains
but also great sheets of lava resting on the limestone surface are
conspicuous.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">

</div>
<p>It was during the last great era in geological history, and for
the most part after the Colorado River had already started to cut
the Grand Canyon, that molten masses broke through and flowed
out on the northern Arizona plateau. Three great periods of such
volcanic activity are represented by the rocks of this region and
they range in age from probably at least a million to relatively
recent years.</p>
<p>The first general period of eruption in the San Francisco Volcanic
Field was characterized by a predominance of lava flows which
formed a black rock known as basalt. These flows had an average
thickness of about 50 feet and covered an area of 3,000 square
miles. Accompanying them was the formation of about a hundred
small cinder cones.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/pg027a.jpg" alt="San Francisco Mountain Volcanic Field" width="500" height="454" />
</div>
<p>It was during the second period of volcanism that six isolated
cones of large size and a somewhat greater number of small cones
were formed by the eruption of lavas widely ranging in composition.
San Francisco Peak, the largest of these cones and a dominant
feature of the region reaches an elevation of 12,611 feet
above sea level, or about 5,000 feet above the plateau surface.
It is composed of five different types, of lava&mdash;mostly red or
light colored&mdash;which represent a corresponding number of distinct
stages in eruption. Since the termination of its building-up,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the crest of this cone has been eroded and worn away to
the extent of 3,000 feet as estimated from restored cross-sections.
Other large volcanic craters of this period are Bill Williams (9,090
feet), Kendrick (10,418 feet), O&rsquo;Leary (8,925 feet) and Sitgreaves
(9,240 feet).</p>
<p>Two hundred small cones and about twenty cubic miles of lava
were produced in this same general region during a third and
relatively recent period of volcanic activity. Much of this material
overlies that of the two preceding periods. Probably the most
interesting feature of these cones and flows is their age, at least
one cone being so recent that ash from it buried numerous pithouses
built by Pueblo Indians during the eleventh century, A. D.</p>

<p>It was during the fifth and last great era in the earth&rsquo;s history that
mammals developed and that man made his appearance on earth.
In many places in the world the remains of animals that lived during
various parts of this age have been preserved. In the famous
asphalt pits of California literally hundreds of the bones of large
mammals&mdash;tigers, mastodons, wolves and many others&mdash;have been brought
to light. In the receding ice of northern Siberia, large
mammoths&mdash;elephant-like animals representative of the last era,
but unknown today&mdash;have come to the surface with even their skin
and flesh preserved. But in the Grand Canyon region few fossils
of the more recent times remain to tell the story of the life that
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
then roamed over this surface. For long ages this region has been
above the level of the sea, erosion has been continuous, so sediments
have not accumulated and consequently few records of life have
been made.</p>
<p>Recently near the western Navajo Indian agency at Tuba City,
Arizona, however, the remains of several extinct animals were
discovered. In a
spring, hidden in a
sandstone crevice,
were found the tusks
of a mammoth and
some teeth which
belonged to camels
and bison. These
were creatures native
to this country
not far back in
history. They give
but a very fragmentary
insight into the more recent geologic history of the region,
but they open up a field for interesting speculation to the imaginative
person.</p>

<h3 id="c34">ADVENT OF MAN IN THE SOUTHWEST
<br /><span class="small">(PLEISTOCENE HISTORIC)</span></h3>
<p>After reviewing the chapters of the earth&rsquo;s history and witnessing
the procession and the slow but steady development of life through
the ages, it is very natural that one should wonder when man came
upon the scene. Compared with the hundreds of millions of years
which have elapsed since the time of the first plants, or the millions
of years following the first appearance of vertebrate animals, the
age of man is as nothing. In the Old World there is evidence that
humans existed before the last great Ice Ages, more than a million
years ago, but in the Americas human occupation is measured in
terms of thousands of years only.</p>
<p>Numerous recent discoveries in widely scattered parts of the
Southwest indicate that man first occupied this region at a time
when it was still inhabited by such animals as the ground sloth, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
mammoth and the camel. Artifacts of stone and bone have been
found associated with the remains of these animals. Early man&rsquo;s
camp sites are located along the margins of former extensive water
bodies that existed throughout this region at a time when the climate
was far more humid than now. Little is known about the nature
or habits of these men, but it is supposed that they were hunters
with no knowledge of agriculture.</p>
<p>In the Grand Canyon region, the earliest human history with a
clear, detailed record goes back only to about 300 A. D. From that
time up to the present, however, the story of a flourishing and
rapidly changing civilization is well recorded. Although no written
documents have been left, abundant reliable information is available
as a result of archeological excavations. Even the dates of
many important events have been accurately determined through
an ingenious method of calculating years on the basis of growth
rings in the trees used
for house construction.</p>

</div>
<p>Two distinct cultures
are represented in the
people who have inhabited
the Grand
Canyon region for the
past 1,600 years. The
earlier and more primitive
was that of a
long-headed type of
man known as the
Basketmaker. This culture
was replaced at
about 700 A. D. by
another, probably the
result of new people
entering the area, mixing
with the older inhabitants
and introducing
new ideas. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
broad-headed type of man who lived in pueblos and made pottery
was the result. In the earliest stages he built only small one-roomed
houses and made relatively crude pottery, but by 1,200
A. D. his architecture and crafts had developed to a very high
stage as witnessed in the largest cliff-dwellings and pueblos of the
region. Since then the culture has declined. The Hopi Indians of
today who live near the Painted Desert Country to the east of
Grand Canyon are considered to be modern representatives of this
group.</p>
<p>In numerous localities throughout southern Utah burials of the
early Farmer Basketmaker period and also pithouses of the later
Potter Basketmaker period have been found. One of the latter has
also been discovered near Clear Creek in Grand Canyon. The remains
of cliff-dwellings and surface houses built by the later
Pueblo Indians are common everywhere throughout the region and
show all stages of development. Those at and in the Grand Canyon
are typical of the intermediate periods and, judging from pottery
fragments in them, were made by the ancestors of the modern Hopi.</p>
